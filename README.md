## What is GrammatikTAK Datasets?
A collection of human annotated datasets for everyone to use.

We felt that the danish NLP community could benefit from having a high-quality, human annotated dataset to use when testing NLP models or for other usage. 

## How to use?
You are free to use whatever file you want. Here is a description. 
- Every file is focused on one specific error in the selected language (currently only danish - we would like to expand this to other nordics languages). 
- Every file has a wrong version of the sentence on the left and a correct version of the sentence on the right.
